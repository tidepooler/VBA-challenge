# VBA-challenge
This project includes a script created and tested on test data and then applied to stock market data

The instructions for the project include the following:

1) Making a new repository on Github.
2) Add VBA files that I use for this assignment, including any main scripts for each analysis
3) Develop scripts using a provided Excel document with test data, which would not take as long to run and obtain results.
4) When all the scripts appear to be correct, run them on a separate Excel document with the Stock data to generate the final report.

My project includes the following instructions:

•	Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
o	The ticker symbol.
o	Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
o	The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
o	The total stock volume of the stock.
•	You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

There are additional challenges to the project that I did not have time to complete.

This VBA project is to be used as a macro in Excel, with multiple year Stock Market data which includes a ticker symbol, a date with year, month, and day, an opening price, a high and low price for the day, a closing price, and a volume of the stock for that day. If the information is provided in the spreadsheet in that order with the following column titles, anyone should be able to use the final script to obtain the information outlined above:

<ticker>	<date>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<vol>
